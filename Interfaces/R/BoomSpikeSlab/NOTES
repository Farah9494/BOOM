This package uses igraph to plot the network structure of a forward neural net,
which I don't expect users to encounter very often.

At least one user has complained that igraph is not available on their system,
so I would like to make it optional, and simply return an error if it is not
installed, in the one place where it is used.

I attempted to follow suggestion to use requireNamespace instead of require in
the package code, but doing so raised an error that 'igraph' was a missing
global variable.  This was after adding the igraph:: namespace prefix to igraph
related calls.  My suspicion is that this is related to igraph and there is not
much I can do about it.
